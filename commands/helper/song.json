        "*Oh, you may not think I’m pretty,\nBut don’t judge on what you see,\nI’ll eat myself if you can find\nA smarter hat than me.\nYou can keep your bowlers black,\nYour top hats sleek and tall,\nFor I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat\nAnd I can cap them all.\nThere’s nothing hidden in your head\nThe Sorting Hat can’t see,\nSo try me on and I will tell you\nWhere you ought to be.\nYou might belong in Gryffindor,\nWhere dwell the brave at heart,\nTheir daring, nerve and chivalry\nSet Gryffindors apart;\nYou might belong in Hufflepuff,\nWhere they are just and loyal,\nThose patient Hufflepuffs are true\nAnd unafraid of toil;\nOr yet in wise old Ravenclaw,\nIf you’ve a ready mind,\nWhere those of wit and learning,\nWill always find their kind;\nOr perhaps in Slytherin\nYou’ll make your real friends,\nThose cunning folk use any means\nTo achieve their ends.\nSo put me on! Don’t be afraid!\nAnd don’t get in a flap!\nYou’re in safe hands (though I have none)\nFor I’m a Thinking Cap!*",
        "*A thousand years or more ago,\nWhen I was newly sewn,\nThere lived four wizards of renown,\nWhose names are still well known:\nBold Gryffindor, from wild moor,\nFair Ravenclaw, from glen,\nSweet Hufflepuff, from valley broad,\nShrewd Slytherin, from fen.\nThey shared a wish, a hope, a dream,\nThey hatched a daring plan\nTo educate young sorcerers\nThus Hogwarts School began.\nNow each of these four founders\nFormed their own house, for each\nDid value different virtues\nIn the ones they had to teach.\nBy Gryffindor, the bravest were\nPrized far beyond the rest;\nFor Ravenclaw, the cleverest\nWould always be the best;\nFor Hufflepuff, hard workers were\nMost worthy of admission;\nAnd power-hungry Slytherin\nLoved those of great ambition.\nWhile still alive they did divide\nTheir favorites from the throng,\nYet how to pick the worthy ones\nWhen they were dead and gone?\n‘Twas Gryffindor who found the way,\nHe whipped me off his head\nThe founders put some brains in me\nSo I could choose instead!\nNow slip me snug about your ears,\nI’ve never yet been wrong,\nI’ll have a look inside your mind\nAnd tell where you belong!*",
        "*In times of old when I was new\nAnd Hogwarts barely started\nThe founders of our noble school\nThought never to be parted:\nUnited by a common goal,\nThey had the selfsame yearning,\nTo make the world’s best magic school\nAnd pass along their learning.\n“Together we will build and teach!”\nThe four good friends decided\nAnd never did they dream that they\nMight someday be divided,\nFor were there such friends anywhere\nAs Slytherin and Gryffindor?\nUnless it was the second pair\nOf Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw?\nSo how could it have gone so wrong?\nHow could such friendships fail?\nWhy, I was there and so can tell\nThe whole sad, sorry tale.\nSaid Slytherin, “We’ll teach just those\nWhose ancestry is purest.”\nSaid Ravenclaw, “We’ll teach those whose\nIntelligence is surest.”\nSaid Gryffindor, “We’ll teach all those\nWith brave deeds to their name,”\nSaid Hufflepuff, “I’ll teach the lot,\nAnd treat them just the same.”\nThese differences caused little strife\nWhen first they came to light,\nFor each of the four founders had\nA House in which they might\nTake only those they wanted, so,\nFor instance, Slytherin*",
        "*Took only pure-blood wizards\nOf great cunning, just like him,\nAnd only those of sharpest mind\nWere taught by Ravenclaw\nWhile the bravest and the boldest\nWent to daring Gryffindor.\nGood Hufflepuff, she took the rest,\nAnd taught them all she knew,\nThus the Houses and their founders\nRetained friendships firm and true.\nSo Hogwarts worked in harmony\nFor several happy years,\nBut then discord crept among us\nFeeding on our faults and fears.\nThe Houses that, like pillars four,\nHad once held up our school,\nNow turned upon each other and,\nDivided, sought to rule.\nAnd for a while it seemed the school\nMust meet an early end,\nWhat with dueling and with fighting\nAnd the clash of friend on friend\nAnd at last there came a morning\nWhen old Slytherin departed\nAnd though the fighting then died out\nHe left us quite downhearted.\nAnd never since the founders four\nWere whittled down to three\nHave the Houses been united\nAnd they once were meant to be.\nAnd now the Sorting Hat is here\nAnd you all know the score:\nI sort you into Houses\nBecause that is what I’m for,\nBut this year I’ll go further,\nListen closely to my song:*",
        "*Though condemned I am to split you\nStill I worry that it’s wrong,\nThough I must fulfill my duty\nAnd must quarter every year\nStill I wonder whether sorting\nMay not bring the end I fear.\nOh, know the perils, read the signs,\nThe warning history shows,\nFor our Hogwarts is in danger\nFrom external, deadly foes\nAnd we must unite inside her\nOr we’ll crumble from within.\nI have told you, I have warned you…\nLet the Sorting now begin.*"
